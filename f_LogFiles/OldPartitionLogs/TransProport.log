Host:    ctag (SSE4.2, 125 GB RAM)
Command: iqtree -s TransSM.fasta -pre TransProport -spp TransParts.nex -m MFP+Merge -bb 1000
Seed:    407987 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Mon May  4 02:25:57 2020
Kernel:  SSE2 - 1 threads (24 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 24 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.

Reading partition model file TransParts.nex ...
Reading alignment file TransSM.fasta ... Fasta format detected
Alignment most likely contains DNA/RNA sequences
Alignment has 94 sequences with 11913 columns, 8960 distinct patterns
8118 parsimony-informative, 928 singleton sites, 2867 constant sites
