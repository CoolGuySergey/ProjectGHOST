Host:    ctag (SSE4.2, 125 GB RAM)
Command: iqtree -s MafftSM.fasta -pre MafftProport -spp MafftParts.nex -m MFP+Merge -bb 1000 -bsam GENESITE
Seed:    246658 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Wed Apr 29 15:11:58 2020
Kernel:  SSE2 - 1 threads (24 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 24 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.

Reading partition model file MafftParts.nex ...
Reading alignment file MafftSM.fasta ... Fasta format detected
Alignment most likely contains DNA/RNA sequences
Alignment has 94 sequences with 12340 columns, 9304 distinct patterns
8208 parsimony-informative, 995 singleton sites, 3137 constant sites
